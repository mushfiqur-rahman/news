## About

This is my first raw php project that I developed in 2017. Design not good but this project helped me to be confident about programming. 

### Features

- User Registration
- User Login
- Admin is able Post new news
- Every post will save as a html file in `articles` folder with the news title
- `articles` path save in `database`. So the application won't go **Heavvy.** 😊
- Vititos are able to `comment`, `Like` and `Dislike` too 😀
- Visitors need to `Login` to do `comment`, `Like` and `Dislike`
- Visitors `profile picture` will display with `comment` & another user is able to reply
