<p>E-commerce is growing fast in Italy, but online sales account for only 10% of overall retail sales, according to consultancy EY, half the European average.</p>
<p>The Verdi trade union said people are also striking at six warehouses in Germany over pay and working conditions.</p>
<p>In a statement, Verdi board member Stefanie Nutzberger, said workers faced "high pressure to create more and more in less time, permanent performance controls and monitoring, [and] a poor leadership culture".</p>
<p>Luigi Giove, Secretary General of Italy's CGIL union, said those on strike are calling for shifts which are "not exhausting" and for Amazon to redistribute its profits<u></u></p>
