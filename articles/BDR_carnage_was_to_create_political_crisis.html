<h2><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>BDR carnage was carried out by some designing quarter to create a political crisis and damage the country&rsquo;s democracy, the High Court today observed in its verdict in the case.</strong></span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The HC also observed from the facts and circumstances of the case that there was a plot and conspiracy either from internal and external sources to uproot, dethrone and depose the newly formed government headed by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina following the general election in 2008.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The BDR rebels in collaboration with the others sharing their common intention and common object following a criminal conspiracy hatched in secrecy deliberately killed the army officers with a view to exterminating them from the BDR and establishing their full control and supremacy over the force.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No provocation, no criminal conspiracy, no dissatisfaction and no grievance can justify this sort of atrocities and massacre committed in the Pilkhana atrociously killing 74 persons including 57 high-ups and promising army officers unless there was a plot or conspiracy behind the BDR carnage&rdquo;, the HC said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The incident is an unprecedented event in the history of crime. By that carnage, the nation has lost some promising, pride, distinguished, luminous and outstanding army officers and it will take a long time to fill up the vacuum, the court said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The offences committed by the disgruntled BDR rebels are very shocking, gruesome and diabolical in nature which cannot be accepted and tolerated by the civilised society and the same exceeded all limits of barbarism and incivility, it observed.</p>
