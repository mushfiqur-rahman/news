<p class="story-body__introduction">A boat carrying eight men claiming to be North Korean fishermen has washed ashore the coast in Japan.</p>
<p>Japanese police said the men were found at Yurihonjo city's marina late on Thursday, and taken into custody.</p>
<p>The men had told authorities that their boat experienced difficulties and they ended up drifting into Japanese waters.</p>
<p>Japan regularly sees North Korean fishing boats straying into its territory, and its coastguard has occasionally had to rescue fishermen.</p>
<p>But sometimes the boats - often simple or rickety vessels - are found with bodies onboard, indicating that the vessels had been drifting for some time.</p>
