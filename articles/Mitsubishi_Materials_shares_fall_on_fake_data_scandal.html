<p class="story-body__introduction">Mitsubishi Materials, a division of one of Japan's biggest conglomerates, saw shares fall by as much 11% on Friday after <a class="story-body__link" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42096165">admitting to a quality scandal</a>.</p>
<p>Three of its units were found to have falsified data for products supplied to nearly 300 companies in the aerospace, car and electric power industries.</p>
<p>No safety issues have been reported.</p>
<p>The discovery is the latest in a string of scandals tarnishing the image of corporate Japan and its reputation for precision manufacturing.</p>
<p>Kobe Steel, Mitsubishi Motors, Nissan and Subaru all recently admitted to manipulating data. Several of them saw the quality lapses stretch on for decades.</p>
