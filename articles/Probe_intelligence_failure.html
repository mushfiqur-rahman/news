<h2><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Bangladesh&rsquo;s High Court has called for investigating&nbsp;the failure of intelligence into the then Bangladesh Rifles in the purview of Pilkhana carnage of 2009.</strong></span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The call was made in a seven-point recommendation placed forward by Justice Md Nazrul Islam while delivering the death referral and appeal verdicts in the carnage case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>His seven recommendations are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Prohibiting activities or programmes like Operation Dal-Bhat that belittles the pride and self respect of what is Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) members now.</li>
<li>Prohibiting any activity or programme that &ldquo;gradually degenerates&rdquo; the soldierly attitude and behaviour of the members of the BGB.</li>
<li>Taking into consideration and deliver fast decision/reply to problems of the BGB men</li>
<li>Authorities mitigate all the grievances, if any that still remains inside, of the BGB men</li>
<li>Consider the leave matter of BGB men which are due and solve all problems regarding leave and other matters.</li>
<li>Form a body and launch inquiry into as to why the intelligence unit of then Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) failed to deliver information beforehand and disclose the findings.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two other judges of the bench, its leading member Justice Shawkat Hossain and Justice Md Abu Zafor Siddique, agreed with the recommendations placed by Justice Islam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seventy-four people, including 57 army officers, were killed during the mutiny on February 25-26 in 2009 at Pilkhana headquarters of the paramilitary force, later renamed Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB).</p>
