<p class="story-body__introduction">When Russia's most notorious hackers hired servers from a UK-registered company, they left a trove of clues behind, the BBC has discovered.</p>
<p>The hackers used the computers to attack the German parliament, hijack traffic meant for a Nigerian government website and target Apple devices.</p>
<p>The company, Crookservers, had claimed to be based in Oldham for a time.</p>
<p>It says it acted swiftly to eject the hacking team - dubbed Fancy Bear - as soon as it learned of the problem.</p>
<p>Technical and financial records from Crookservers seen by the BBC suggest Fancy Bear had access to significant funds and made use of online financial services, some of which were later closed in anti-money laundering operations.</p>
