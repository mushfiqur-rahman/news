<p class="story-body__introduction">The UK's largest insurer will allow all new parents the same amount of paid leave after the arrival of a child.</p>
<p>Aviva will offer its 16,000 employees 26 weeks leave on full basic pay, regardless of their gender or sexual orientation.</p>
<p>The policy applies to parents who have given birth, adopted or chosen surrogacy.</p>
<p>But the industry body for personnel managers, the CIPD, said men's take-up of shared parental leave remained low.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the CIPD said Aviva's move was a significant and positive step.</p>
