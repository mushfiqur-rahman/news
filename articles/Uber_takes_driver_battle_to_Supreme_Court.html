<p class="story-body__introduction">Uber plans to take its fight over the employment status of its UK drivers to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Earlier this month the Employment Appeal Tribunal <a class="story-body__link" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41940018">rejected the ride-hailing firm's argument</a> about the status of employees.</p>
<p>Unions argue that staff should be classified as "workers" rather than being self-employed.</p>
<p>Such a move would entitle them to rights such as holiday pay and sick leave.</p>
<p>Uber could have first taken the case to the Court of Appeal.</p>

<p>An Uber spokesman said it had requested permission to appeal directly to the Supreme Court so that the case "can be resolved sooner rather than later".</p>

<p>Drivers James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam took a case to an employment tribunal last year, arguing they were Uber staff and entitled to holiday pay, paid rest breaks and the minimum wage.</p>
<p>After the Employment Appeal Tribunal upheld the original tribunal ruling, Uber UK's acting general manager Tom Elvidge said: "Almost all taxi and private hire drivers have been self-employed for decades, long before our app existed.<u></u></p>
