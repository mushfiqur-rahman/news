<p class="story-body__introduction">Football transfers were catapulted off the sports pages into the global media spotlight this year when Paris St-Germain broke - or rather smashed - the world record fee to snatch Brazilian star Neymar from Barcelona this summer.</p>
<p>The French club <a class="story-body__link" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40762417">paid an eye-watering 222m euros ($260m; &pound;200m) for the player</a>, more than <a class="story-body__link" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37016170">doubling the previous record set when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United</a> from Juventus for &pound;89m in August 2016.</p>
<p>But that very prominent deal was just the very visible peak of a huge industry, namely the international trade in football players, which is becoming more and more of a global business.</p>
<p>Latest data from Fifa, the sport's governing body, show there have been 15,291 international transfers so far in 2017, with total spending on players hitting a record $6bn (&pound;4.58bn).</p>
<p>International transfers are ones where a player moves from one country to another, as opposed to domestic transfers which take place between two clubs in the same country.</p>

<p>That record figure - which is unlikely to change by the end of the year as player transfer windows in the biggest European leagues are not due to open again until January 2018 - is a 25% increase on the $4.8bn spent in 2016. <u></u></p>
